# Boston housing prediction
In this project we apply basic concepts of machine learning on the Boston housing dataset.
We first perform a basic analysis of the dataset, define the metrics and train a decision tree regressor. The model is finally refined using grid search.

## Requirements
This project was implemented with **Python 2.7** and the following librairies :
- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)

## Usage
Run the jupyter notebook.
```sh
$ jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```
