# Boston housing prediction
In this project we apply basic concepts of machine learning on the Boston housing dataset.
We first perform a basic analysis of the dataset, define the metrics and train a decision tree regressor. The model is finally refined using grid search.

## Requirements
- Python 2.7
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook


## Usage
Run the jupyter notebook.
```
$ jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb
```
